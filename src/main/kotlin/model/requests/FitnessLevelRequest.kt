    Based on the following responses to a running fitness assessment questionnaire, determine the runner's fitness level as either BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, or ADVANCED. Only return one of these three fitness levels, with no additional text or explanation.

    Fitness Assessment Responses:
    1. Weekly running distance: $weeklyRunningDistance
    2. Longest recent run and how it felt: $longestRecentRun
    3. Running experience (how long running regularly): $runningExperience
    4. Current injuries or recurring issues: $currentInjuries
    5. Usual pace: $pace

    Guidelines for classification:
    - BEGINNER: New to running, low weekly mileage (under 15km/10mi), no long runs over 5km, less than 6 months consistent running, may have injury concerns, basic goals like finishing a distance
    - INTERMEDIATE: Regular runner for 6+ months, weekly mileage of 15-40km, can complete 10km runs comfortably, some race experience, specific time goals
    - ADVANCED: Experienced runner (1+ years consistent training), 40+km, regular long runs of 15km+ with good recovery, minimal injury concerns, performance-oriented goals

    Based on this information, the runner's fitness level is:
